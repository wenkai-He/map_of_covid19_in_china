# map_of_covid19_in_china
It is a simple demo about Covid19 in China.

STEP:
1.Open the node_covid19 by "node .\index.js"
2.Open the covid19_china_map by "npm start"
3.You can click the switch button to see Existing confirmed cases and Cumulative confirmed cases



For the back-end,I use express to get the data.I think it is like simulating a server with the same port.

For the front-end,I use react and echarts to show the map.
